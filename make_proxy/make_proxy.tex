\section{Introduction}

Paper \href{https://wg21.link/p3086}{3086} proposed a \textit{Pointer-Semantics-Based Polymorphism Library},
which is designed to help people build extendable and efficient polymorphic programs with better abstractions and less intrusive code.
This paper is proposing the utility part that is separated from early versions of paper 3086 and paper \href{https://wg21.link/p0957}{0957}.

More specifically, we are eager to add function template \textit{make\_proxy} together with the \textit{proxy} library into the standard as a library feature.
\textit{make\_proxy} is designed to provide simple ways to construct \textit{proxy} instances from values. Its syntax is similar to the constuctors of \verb|std::any|.
With \textit{make\_proxy}, SBO (small buffer optimization) may implicitly apply, depending on library implementation.
